“SafeGuard Pro” —— A smart hazard detection and alarm system:

A dependable system for detecting hazardous behaviors and unsafe conditions in a real- time manner is necessary to prevent accidents and ensure compliance with safety regulations.

1.Behavioral Monitoring Using API: Cameras installed in the workshop can capture real-time footage of workers and equipment, 
CCTV cameras with IP can help to locate the position of different production lines. This project can use OpenCV to process the video streams information.


2.Enviornment Monitoring Using API:
Use sensors connected with a cloud platform to monitor environmental conditions such as temperature or humidity. 
This function can ensure track dangerous conditions like gas leaks, high temperatures or excessive noise levels.
